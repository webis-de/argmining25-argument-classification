2. Argument from Expert Opinion

Major Premise: Source $E$ is an expert in subject domain $S$ containing proposition $A$.
Minor Premise: $E$ asserts that proposition $A$ is true (false).
Conclusion: $A$ is true (false).


6. Argument from Example

Premise: In this particular case, the individual $a$ has property $F$ and also property $G$.
Conclusion: Therefore, generally, if $x$ has property $F$, then it also has property $G$.


7. Argument from Analogy

Similarity Premise: Generally, case $C_1$ is similar to case $C_2$.
Base Premise: $A$ is true (false) in case $C_1$.
Conclusion: $A$ is true (false) in case $C_2$.


13. Argument from Alternatives

Major Premise: Either $X$ or $Y$ can be the case.
Minor Premise: $X$ is plausibly not the case.
Conclusion: $Y$ is plausibly the case.


19. Argument from Values

This scheme has a positive and negative version.

19.1. Positive Value

Premise 1: Value $V$ is positive as judged by agent $A$ (judgment value).
Premise 2: The fact that value $V$ is positive affects the interpretation and therefore
the evaluation of goal $G$ of agent $A$ (if value $V$ is good, it supports commitment to goal $G$).
Conclusion: $V$ is a reason for retaining commitment to goal $G$.

19.2. Negative Value

Premise 1: Value $V$ is negative as judged by agent $A$ (judgment value).
Premise 2: The fact that value $V$ is negative affects the interpretation and therefore the evaluation of goal $G$ of agent $A$ (if value $V$ is bad, it goes against commitment to goal $G$).
Conclusion: $V$ is a reason for retracting commitment to goal $G$.


28. Argument from Cause to Effect

Major Premise: Generally, if $A$ occurs, then $B$ will (might) occur.
Minor Premise: In this case, $A$ occurs (might occur).
Conclusion: Therefore, in this case, $B$ will (might) occur.


33.1. Argument from Positive Consequences

Premise: If $A$ is brought about, good consequences will plausibly occur.
Conclusion: Therefore, $A$ should be brought about.


33.2. Argument from Negative Consequences

Premise: If $A$ is brought about, then bad consequences will occur.
Conclusion: Therefore, $A$ should not be brought about.
